# Tunneler remake
A javascript remake of the original [Tunneler DOS game](https://tunneler.org/) written by Geoffrey Silverton in 1990. No source code for the original game [is avaiable](https://tunneler.org/faq/), so the game was created from scratch.

:bangbang: **Work in progress - not all original features yet implemented (95% completed)**:bangbang:  

:x:**Missing features:**
- The logic of tunneling slower through dirt / fast when shooting at the same time
- Random boulders near the edges of the game area
- Big explosion spread logic visually a bit different than original in current version

## Online Multiplayer
While the original game was played on one computer in a split-screen mode, the remake features an online multiplayer.

## How to play
- Move the tank with **arrow keys** :arrow_up::arrow_down::arrow_left::arrow_right:
- Shoot with **space**, **x**, or **Numpad0**
